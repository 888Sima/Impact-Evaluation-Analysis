An evaluation was carried out to measure the impact of a treatment—likely an educational intervention—on student outcomes across two states. The process began with uploading and extracting a ZIP file containing the datasets, after which column names were cleaned and standardized for consistency.

In the first stage of the analysis, descriptive statistics were produced for State 1. This included calculating the proportion of female students, determining the average age of treated male students, and identifying the school with the highest number of 12-year-old students.

To ensure comparability between treated and untreated groups, a balance check was conducted by regressing age on treatment status, using school-level clustered standard errors to account for potential intra-school correlation.

Following this, the effect of the treatment on standardized language scores was analyzed separately for each state using ordinary least squares (OLS) regression. Clustered standard errors were again applied at the school level. Based on the resulting p-values, it was determined whether the treatment had a statistically significant impact on student performance in each context.
